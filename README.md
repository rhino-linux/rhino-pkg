A package manager wrapper for Pacstall, APT, Flatpak and snap.

### Usage
```
USAGE: rhino-pkg [function] {flag} <input>

functions:
    install: Install package(s) - Prompts user to respond with
             the number(s) associated with the desired package(s).

    remove:  Uninstall package(s) - Prompts user to respond with
             the number(s) associated with the desired package(s).

    search:  Search for package(s) - Does not have a second prompt.

    update:  Updates all packages accessible to the wrapper - does
             not accept <input>, instead use install to update
             individual packages. Has a confirmation prompt.

    cleanup: Attempts to repair broken dependencies and remove any
             unused packages. Does not accept <input>, but has
             a confirmation prompt.

flags:
    --help/-h: Display this page

    --description/-d: By default, rhino-pkg will only display packages
    that contain <input> within their name. Use this flag to increase
    range and display packages with <input> in their description.

    -y: Makes functions with confirmation prompts run promptless.

input:
    Provide a package name or description.
