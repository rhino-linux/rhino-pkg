             the number(s) associated with the desired package(s).
             
    remove:  Uninstall package(s) - Prompts user to respond with
             the number(s) associated with the desired package(s).
             
    search:  Search for package(s) - Does not have a second prompt.

### How you can help
* Work on translations into languages not finished yet by either editing the `po/<language_code>.po` file, making a new one by running `cp po/rhino-pkg.pot po/<language_code>.po`, or using weblate (https://weblate.makedeb.org/projects/rhino-linux/rhino-pkg/). Once you have completed or partially completed a po file, make a PR and we will merge it! Our goal is to have as many languages translated as possible due to the amount of people who may not be fluent in English.
